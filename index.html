        I recently completed the 5-day HTML challenge with the Institute of
        Code, and it was such a fun intro to web development! I learned how to
        build and structure web pages using basic HTML. It was a great way to
        start exploring coding in a hands-on way. The challenge really motivated
        me to keep going and learn even more!
